# Week 19 {-}


Arsenal and Liverpool showing why they are fun to watch but won't be winning major trophies. Only second 3-3 scoreline this year in the league and Liverpool also fetaured in the other (v Watford)

## Kane is Able {-}

Some eyebrows were raised when Harry Kane was rated by a [Guardian poll](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/19/the-100-best-footballers-in-the-world-2017-interactive) of 169 experts  as the fifth best player in the world for 2017 but he certainly did his best to justify that ranking with a hat-trick at high-flying Burnley

He now (at the time of writing) jointly - holds the record for most Premier League goals in a calendar year with one game remaining and is one of only three players to have led in that category and scored at the rate of more than a goal per 90 minutes played


```{r}

playerGame %>% 
    filter(PLAYERID!="OWNGOAL") %>% 
    select(PLAYERID,name,Gls,gameDate,mins) %>% 
    mutate(year=year(gameDate)) %>% 
    group_by(PLAYERID,name,year) %>% 
    summarize(tot=sum(Gls),totMins=sum(mins)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    arrange(desc(tot)) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    slice(1) %>% 
    mutate(gpg=round(90*tot/totMins,2)) %>% 
    plot_ly(x=~year,y=~tot) %>% 
 
    add_bars(color= ~year,
             hoverinfo="text",
             text=~paste0(name,
                          "<br>Goals: ",tot,
                          "<br>Gls per 90mins: ",gpg)) %>% 
 hide_colorbar() %>% 
  layout(
    title="Leading Scorer in Calendar year",
    xaxis=list(title=""),
    yaxis=list(title="Goals Scored")
  ) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)
  
    

```
_NB 1992 only includes goals from August on_

Kane was also the leader two years ago and will have Alan Shearer's four time winner's record in his sights
Surprising winners? How about Robbie Keane 2007 and Wilfried Bony, 2014

<p class="factoid">Kane's 7th minute penalty ended a goal-drought three minutes shy of his season longest of 305 minutes </p>

Here is a table of players who have led their team in scoring for each calendar year    

Sort and filter the table, as desired


```{r}
 playerGame %>% 
    filter(PLAYERID!="OWNGOAL") %>% 
    select(PLAYERID,name,Gls,gameDate,mins,TEAMNAME) %>% 
    mutate(year=year(gameDate)) %>% 
    group_by(PLAYERID,name,year,TEAMNAME) %>% 
    summarize(tot=sum(Gls),totMins=sum(mins)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    arrange(desc(tot),totMins) %>% 
    group_by(year,TEAMNAME) %>%
    slice(1) %>% 
    mutate(gpg=round(90*tot/totMins,2)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(gpg)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(rank=row_number()) %>% 
 # slice(2:11) %>% 
    select(rank,team=TEAMNAME,year,name,Goals=tot,`Goals per 90 mins`=gpg) %>%
                         DT::datatable(width=700,class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))
  

```

## Arsenal turnaround {-}

After being comprehensively outplayed for much of the game, Liverpool's defensive frailties enabled the Gunners to score three goals in six minutes through Sanchez, Xhaka and Ozil; before, ultimately, settling for a point    

Just how rare is such a goal blitz

```{r}
scoreLines2 <- scoreLines %>% 
    arrange(mins) %>% 
    group_by(TEAMMATCHID)  %>% 
    mutate(tot_sum = roll_sum(GF, 6, align = "right", fill = NA))


scoreLines2 %>% 
  left_join(teamGames) %>% 
  filter(tot_sum>2) %>% 
  select(TEAMNAME,gameDate,season,MATCHID,mins) %>% 
  left_join(standings) %>% 
  filter(TEAMNAME==team) %>% 
  select(team,OppTeam,GF,GA,gameDate,season,TEAMMATCHID,mins) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mins)) %>% 
  slice(1)   %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(team,desc(gameDate)) %>% 
  select(team,opponents=OppTeam,GF,GA,date=gameDate,season,`last minute`=mins) %>% 
                         DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging =TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))
```

So, it turns out not that uncommon - at least for Arsenal. This is their record, 10th time in the Premier League but the only one in which they have not proved victorious. In fact, goals from Giroud, Sanchez and Ozil did for Huddesfield less than a month ago

The only team to have ever scored four in six minutes are Spurs v Southampton back in 1992/3

This got a pretty good response with some Fulham fans aware that Clint Dempsey notched exactly 50 goals for his club

## Final Factoid{-}

<p class="factoid">Last season, Raheem Sterling only scored three league goals after 24th September which was matched or bettered by 108 other players. This season he currently is in sole position of 4th place</p>

## End of Season Update {-}

.. by major trophies I inadvertently missed out the Europa Cup and Champion's league

---

#### Kane is Able

Kane has trundled along with another 25+ goals season but he has been surpassed by Mo Salah's(22nd on the above mentioned world ranking) astounding season

As can be seen on the chart above, He has already scored 15 in 2018 and almost caught several calendar year record leaders such as Bony (20 in 2014). Bony really was a one-year wonder as this accounts for 57% of his career output

```{r}

playerGame %>% 
  filter(PLAYERID=="BONYW",Gls>0) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(gameDate)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(tot=sum(Gls)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~year, y=~tot, width= 400) %>% 
  add_bars(color=I("green")) %>% 
  layout(title="Wilfried Bony's Goals by Calendar year",
         xaxis=list(title="Goals"),
         yaxis=list(title="")) %>% config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)

```

Still only 29, he was a bench player at struggling Swansea with no goals
to his name in 2018 when he suffered a season-ending injury in early February

---

There have actually only been twent-eight 25+goal seasons  and Kane is just one behind matching Shearer for four years in a row. Rooney is the only player with more than one non-consecutive season (2009/10 & 2011/12)

The 305 minute drought Kane endured at the beginning of the season proved his longest spell without goals all campaign

```{r}
playerGame %>% 
  filter(PLAYERID!="OWNGOAL") %>% 
  group_by(name,PLAYERID,season) %>% 
  summarize(Goals=sum(Gls)) %>% 
  arrange(season) %>% 
  mutate(cat=ifelse(Goals>24,1,0)) %>% 
   do(subSeq(.$cat)) %>% 
    filter(value==1) %>% 
  select(name,run=slength) %>% 
  arrange(desc(run)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(player=name,run) %>% 
                         DT::datatable(width=200,class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))

```

#### Arsenal turnaround {-}

There were no subsequent occurrence of three goals within six minutes. The only other team to perform the feat this season had been Manchester United with Lukaku, Pogba and Martial scoring between the 80 and 84th minute at Swansea in August

---

Sterling maintained his great goal-scoring form, missing plenty but finding the knack for being in the right place at the right time. He now has 49 goals andd they make interesting reading. Just 1 header, 3 from dead-ball situations and 2 from long-range. This season exactly half of his 18 goals have come from inside the six yard box: he leads the league in this category
