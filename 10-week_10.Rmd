# Week 10 {-}



Kane-less Spurs lose to Pogba-less United and trail City by 8 points. Watford's day in the sun may have ended as they suffer back-to-back losses

## Final Top 6? {-}

The accepted 'top six' i.e Chelsea, Spurs, Man City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Man Utd. were generally expected to 
comprise the first half-dozen come the end of the season for the second year running. Only Everton had come within 23 points of them last year - and it is clear they will be now be happy to finish outside of the bottom 6

After 10 rounds and by dint of goal difference, they do form that elite group for the first time. What are the chances that they will hold off all rivals from now on?

```{r top6_10}


final <- c(1:6)


df_in <- standings %>%
  arrange(season, tmYrGameOrder, position)

myFun <- function(x, y) {
  teams <- df_in %>%
    filter(season == x & tmYrGameOrder == y) %>%
    head(6)
  
  now <- teams %>%
    pull(final_Pos)
  
  club <- teams %>%
    mutate(clubs = paste(team, collapse = ", ")) %>%
    pull(clubs)
  
  z <- length(intersect(final, now))
  
  temp_df <- data.frame(
    count = z,
    clubs = club,
    season = x,
    gameOrder = y
  )
  
  return(temp_df)
  
}

#set parameters to map over
gameYears <- standings %>%
  select(tmYrGameOrder, season) %>%
  unique()

season = gameYears$season
gameOrder = gameYears$tmYrGameOrder

df <- map2_df(season, gameOrder, myFun) %>%
  unique() %>% # otherwise replicates 6 x
  group_by(season)


## create shared data allowing crosstalk between select input and chart

sd <- SharedData$new(df)

fs <- filter_select(
  id = "season",
  label = "Select season",
  sharedData = sd,
  group =  ~ season,
  allLevels = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE
)

## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_nobootstrap <- fs

attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(function(dep) {
  dep$name != "bootstrap"
},
attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies"))



chart <- sd %>%
  
  plot_ly(
    x =  ~ gameOrder,
    y =  ~ count,
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text = ~ paste0("Wk ", gameOrder, "<br>", clubs)
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Top 6 teams by Round compared with final table",
    xaxis = list(title = "Games Played"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of end-of-season top 6 teams",
                 rangemode = "tozero")
  ) %>%  config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)



tagList(fs_nobootstrap,
        br(),
        chart)

```

_The default shows all years (the package needs enhancing) so you need to select an individual season_

I have left 2017/18 in: the most recent week will equate to final positions (so will always be 6)_

It turns out that in 2009/10 the top 6 after round 3 finished in the top half-dozen at the end of the season - although there were 14 weeks to follow in which another team would interpose. It was not until Round 35 that these top places were confirmed

<p class="factoid">Man City finally score in first quArter of an hour (and twice to boot). Previously, the leading scorers had been one of seven teams not to register in first 15 minutes</p>

## Attendances {-}

Last week at Wembley, Spurs set the all-time attendance record that had stood for more than a decade

```{r crowd_all_time_10}


teamGames %>%
  filter(venue == "H") %>%
  left_join(teamGames, by = "MATCHID") %>%
  filter(TEAMID.x != TEAMID.y) %>%
  rename(
    team = TEAMNAME.x,
    Opponents = TEAMNAME.y,
    crowd = CROWD.x,
    gameDate = gameDate.x
  ) %>%
  arrange(gameDate, desc(crowd)) %>%
  mutate(maxcrowd = cummax(crowd)) %>%
  select(gameDate, crowd, maxcrowd, team, Opponents) %>%
  filter(crowd == maxcrowd) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x =  ~ gameDate,
    y =  ~ maxcrowd,
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text =  ~ paste0(crowd, "<br>", team, " v ", Opponents,
                     "<br>", gameDate)
  ) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  add_lines(line = list(shape = "hv")) %>%
  layout(
    showlegend = FALSE,
    title = "Record High Attendances at EPL matches<br>Hover for details",
    yaxis = list(title = "Crowd Size"),
    xaxis = list(title = "")
  ) %>%  config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)

```

Other than in the inaugural season, significant changes in record attendance have been basically linked to increases in capacity at Manchester United's ground, Old Trafford. With Tottenham's stay at Wembley of limited duration, one of their games this season is likely to hold sway indefinitely


As the Premier League has got more popular and a higher percentage (if not all) of the crowd is there on season tickets, the range in attendance during a season has narrowed. Back in the day, Manchester United were often a much bigger attraction than some of the lesser teams 




Lets look at individual teams NB problems here

```{r club_attendances2}


data <-teamGames %>%

    filter(venue=="H")  %>%
  inner_join(teamGames,by="MATCHID") %>%
  filter(TEAMID.x!=TEAMID.y) %>%
  rename(Opponents=TEAMNAME.y,crowd=CROWD.x) %>%
   mutate(day=wday(gameDate.x)) %>%
  select(team=TEAMNAME.x,Opponents,crowd,season=season.x,day) %>%
  group_by(team)

sd <- SharedData$new(data)

fs <- filter_select(
id = "team",
label = "Select or Type in Team",
sharedData = sd,
group =  ~ team,
allLevels = FALSE,
multiple = FALSE
)

 ## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_nobootstrap <- fs

attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(
  function(dep) {dep$name != "bootstrap"},
  attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies")
)



chart <- sd %>%
   plot_ly(x=~season,y=~crowd) %>%
   add_markers(hoverinfo="text",
               text=~paste0(Opponents,"<br>",crowd,
                            "<br>", day)) %>%
  layout(title="Reported Attendances by Game <br> Hover for Detail",
         xaxis=list(title=""),
         yaxis=list(title="Crowd Size"),
         margin=list(b=110,pad=5)) %>%
       config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)


 tagList(
  fs_nobootstrap,
  br(),
  chart
)

```

_There could be the odd incorrect outlier_

Wimbledon, for example, had a reasonable capacity but were poorly supported - until one of the big clubs (with many supporters) came along

## Final Factoid {-}

<p class="factoid">Palace record only their second draw in 30 league outings. All time record no-draws run is 28 by Bolton Wanderers</p>

## End of Season Update {-}

#### Final Top 6? {-}

Well the expected materialised. If you enter 2017/18 in the options above you can see that other than weeks 17/18 when Burnley threatened Arsenal and Spurs it was never really in doubt

![](10_BurnleyTop6.PNG)

---

Normality was resumed with  Manchester City managing a league-leading 12 goals in the first quarter of an hour. Stoke City only managed it twice but they won neither game. On the flip side the Potteries conceded  early seven times, obviously a factor in their relegation

---

#### Attendances {-} 

As can be seen, Spurs had a couple more records, posting 83,222 in the derby game versus Spurs

Let's have a look at which teams are the best draws

```{r attendancesu_10u}

df <- teamGames %>% 
  filter(venue=="H") %>% 
  arrange(desc(CROWD)) %>% 
  group_by(TEAMNAME,season) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  left_join(teamGames,by="MATCHID") %>% 
  filter(TEAMNAME.x!=TEAMNAME.y) %>% 
  select(season=season.x,team=TEAMNAME.x,opposition=TEAMNAME.y,attendance=CROWD.x) 

df %>% 
  arrange(desc(season,team)) %>%
                         DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))
```

With many teams selling out each week, it can be a bit hit and miss which team pulls in the most spectators e.g this year Crystal Palace's visit produced the biggest trunout at Old Trafford

Some local rivalries can be noted e.g Bournemouth v Southampton and Manchester United still seem to be the biggest draw - although they no longer match the first two seasons of the League when they were the biggest attraction for 12 of the other clubs

---

Liverpool racked up by far the most drawn games of the top six, with 12. The others ranged between 4 and 8

## Code Hints {-}

 * crosstalk
 * htmltools - tagList
 * purrr - use of map2
 * plotly - combine lines and markers
