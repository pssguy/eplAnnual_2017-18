# Week 18 {-}


Four teams win away from home by at least three goal margins - surprisingly Huddersfield, West Ham and Crystal Palace join Liverpool. Palace on a seven game undefeated run and jump to 14th place

## Who is your Talisman {-}

Some players are regarded as more essential to their teams than others - Pogba at Manchester United or Zaha at Crystal Palace spring to mind. 

As a crude way of assessing this, we can look at the average points per game the team has secured with their services when they are playing or not


Here is the leading player, by each team this season (with a minimum of 5 starts) 


```{r talisman_18}

ppg <- playerGame %>%
  filter(season == "2017/18" & START > 0) %>%
  select(name, TEAMMATCHID, PLAYERID) %>%
  left_join(teamGames) %>%
  left_join(standings, by = c("MATCHID" = "MATCHID", "TEAMNAME" = "team")) %>%
  select(season.x, res, TEAMNAME, name, PLAYERID)   %>%
  
  mutate(points =
           case_when(res == "Win" ~ 3,
                     res == "Draw" ~ 1,
                     res == "Loss" ~ 0)) %>%
  group_by(PLAYERID, TEAMNAME, name) %>%
  summarize(ppg = round(sum(points) / n(), 2), games = n()) %>%
  
  arrange(desc(ppg)) %>%
  
  filter(games > 4) %>%
  rename(team = TEAMNAME)

sd <- SharedData$new(ppg)

fs <- filter_select(
  id = "team",
  label = "Select Team",
  sharedData = sd,
  group =  ~ team,
  allLevels = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE
)

## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_nobootstrap <- fs

attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(function(dep) {
  dep$name != "bootstrap"
},
attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies"))

chart <- sd %>%
  plot_ly(x =  ~ ppg, y =  ~ fct_reorder(name, ppg)) %>% # right order - shows ALL players best bet in combo with yaxis vis=F
  add_markers(
    size =  ~ games,
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text =  ~ paste0(name,
                     "<br>Starts: ", games,
                     "<br>ppg: ", ppg)
  ) %>%
  add_segments(
    x = 0,
    xend = ~ ppg,
    y = ~ fct_reorder(name, ppg),
    yend = ~ fct_reorder(name, ppg),
    showlegend = FALSE,
    color = I("lightgrey")
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Average Team Points per Game when Starter (min 5)<br>Circle size reflects games played",
    margin = list(l = 120),
    xaxis = list(title = "Points per game"),
    yaxis = list(title = "", visible = FALSE)
  )  %>%  config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)


tagList(fs_nobootstrap,
        br(),
        chart)

```

Not an ideal chart, as is, but hover points for more information

Here are leading players, by team. Check back for changes as the season progresses


```{r leaders_18}

ppg %>%
  filter(games > 4) %>%
  arrange(desc(ppg)) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  arrange(desc(ppg)) %>%
  mutate(ppg = round(ppg, 2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-PLAYERID) %>%
  rename(` ` = team,
         ` ` = name,
         `Points per Game` = ppg) %>%
  
  DT::datatable(
    class = 'compact stripe hover row-border order-column',
    rownames = FALSE,
    options = list(
      paging = TRUE,
      searching = TRUE,
      info = FALSE
    )
  )

```

Clearly it will depend on strength of opposition they have faced but, at the time of writing, Pogba does lead his team whilst Zaha is second on his. The under-utilization of Pedro at Chelsea also seems a bit strange as he formed such an integral part of the champions team last year

## Liverpool equal all-time record {-}

Liverpool may have slipped up in a couple of home games but their away dominance continued. The most recent four 
away results 

* West Ham 4-1
* Stoke 3-0
* Brighton 5-1
* Bournemouth 4-0

equals an all-time English League record for consecutive away wins with goal margins of three or more

 Wolves also recorded their victories recently, in League One, 2013/14
 
 * Oldham 3-0
 * Brentford 3-0
 * Walsall 3-0
 * Swindon 4-1
 
 Liverpool's is a bit more impressive but next up is Arsenal so a continuation of the run is unlikely.
 Win by 4 and they will be the first ever to achieve a sequence of three such victories

<p class="factoid">For Palace last week, Sako ended a goal drought of 1262 minutes and Benteke one of 1109.
Townsend extended his to 2103</p>

## End of Season Update {-}

The four big away wins was a Premier League Record for one round of games. Huddersfield and Liverpool(x4) did have other away wins by at least three goal margins. Liverpool's five times lead the league and trails only Manchester City's alltime record of one more, set last season


#### Who is your Talisman {-}

Well Pogba spoilt his copy book to some extent though Zaha continues to inspire Palace - they lost all ten games he did not appear in this season

For Palace,when the centre-back pairing of Tomkins and Sakho appear together they also have yet to be beaten - albeit the sides they have faced have tended to be weaker ones of the division

![](update)

Any number of players can be found on the [premiersoccerstats site](www.premiersoccerstats.com)

Of course, football is a tema game and there are the odd surprises. Aurier has had mixed reviews at Spurs and is no longer a first-choice but his 11-3-2 (W-D-L) record is best for club


#### Liverpool equal all-time record {-}

At one stage in their next game up, Liverpool looked as though they might extend their impressive run as they were 2 up at the Emirates with about 40 minutes of playing time left. However, Arsenal fought back and the game ended in a 3-3 draw

In spite of these stats, Liverpool were not one of the teams to score more on their travels

```{r away_goalsu_18}
home <- standings %>%
  filter(season == "2017/18", venue == "A") %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarize(away = sum(GF))

standings %>%
  filter(season == "2017/18", venue == "H") %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarize(home = sum(GF)) %>%
  inner_join(home) %>%
  mutate(pc = round(100 * away / (home + away), 1)) %>%
  arrange(desc(pc)) %>%
  select(team, home, away, `% away` = pc) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    width = 350,
    height = 400,
    class = 'compact stripe hover row-border order-column',
    rownames = FALSE,
    options = list(
      paging = TRUE,
      searching = FALSE,
      info = FALSE
    )
  )

```


 
 Arsenal's figure of 73 % goals scored at home is the highest proportion they have shown in any of the 26 EPL seasons
