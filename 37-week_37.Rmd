# Week 37 {-}


Only one point from the top four this week-end means Chelsea still have chance to catch Liverpool and Spurs. Stoke are the first team condemned to the drop after losing from a winning position at home



***
<p class="factoid">Liverpool's five goals haul is the 66th time a team has done this since Manchester United last achieved it. Manchester City account for 17 of them</p>

## Assists per Goal {-}

There will be ongoing debate about whether or not Manchester City are the best ever Premier League champions and the lack of a decent rival and the 1-5 aggregate defeat by Liverpool in the Champions Leaguw will both be held against them

However, there is little doubt that they have played some exhilirating football
often involving intricate passing movements ending with a simple tap in. 30 of their goals have been finished off from within the 6 yard box

The number of assists per goal is a crudish method of measuring the type of goal scored

Allowing up to two assists per goal, here is every teams record in Premier League history

```{r team_assists_37}

playerGame %>%
  group_by(season, TEAMNAME) %>%
  summarize(
    tmGoals = sum(Gls),
    tmAss = sum(Assists),
    av = round(tmAss / tmGoals, 2)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(av), desc(tmGoals)) %>%
  select(
    team = TEAMNAME,
    season,
    Goals = tmGoals,
    Assists = tmAss,
    `Assist per Goal` = av
  )  %>%
  DT::datatable(
    class = 'compact stripe hover row-border order-column',
    rownames = FALSE,
    options = list(
      paging = TRUE,
      searching = TRUE,
      info = FALSE
    )
  )

```


A little inconclusive. Manchester City's haul of 146 is already the greatest ever by a team in a season, after just 36 games. However, on a per goal basis they are middle of the pack although well above both Liverpool (think over the top balls to Salah) and Chelsea (think the Azpilicueta-Morata linkup)

Over the league as a whole, assists per goal were at their highest rtae ever; and the top four averages have come in the past four seasons so there seems to have been a marked change. Crystal Palace, for example, posted a significantly higher figure than ever before. Chelsea, on the other hand, dropped 39 assists from the year before - surely in the decline from Champions to also-rans

<p class="factoid">Man City have scored 30 goals with the last contact in the six-yard box - more than Huddersfield or Swansea have managed in total</p>

## Perfect Records {-}

Now we are at the tail end of the season we can see for each player in a team how many games they started in and the record when they did, in terms of points per game

```{r perfect_37}

df <- playerGame %>%
  filter(season == "2017/18" & START > 0) %>%
  select(name, PLAYERID, TEAMMATCHID) %>%
  left_join(standings) %>%
  select(name, team, res, PLAYERID) %>%
  mutate(points = case_when(res == "Win" ~ 3,
                            res == "Draw" ~ 1,
                            res == "Loss" ~ 0)) %>%
  group_by(name, PLAYERID, team) %>%
  summarize(
    games = n(),
    sumPts = sum(points),
    avPts = round(sumPts / games, 2)
  )

df %>%
  plot_ly(
    x =  ~ jitter(games),
    y =  ~ jitter(avPts),
    color =  ~ team
  ) %>%
  add_markers(
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text =  ~ paste0(name, "<br>",
                     team, "<br>Starts: ",
                     games, "<br>PPG: ", avPts)
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Av Team Points in Games Started ",
    xaxis = list(title = "Games Starting"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Av. Points per Game")
  ) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)

```

At the time of publication, Man City's Laporte had a perfect record of seven starts seven wins. On the flip side, Palace's six starts by Puncheon did not result in a single point

## Final Factoid {-}

<p class="factoid">For all the plaudits Roy Hodgson is receiving, under him Crystal Palace have averaged just 1.24 points per game. Immediate predecessors Allardyce, 1.24. and Pardew 1.21 have comparable records</p>

## End of Season Update {-}


#### Assists per Goal {-}

Of course, the Assists leader for Manchester City this year has been Kevin de Bruyne
A recent OptaJoe tweet highlighted the great start to his EPL career 

![](img/37_de_Bruyne_Assists.png)



On the more wide-ranging definition of an assist, I use, de Bruyne also heads the list with 70 assists. Generally speaking, the usual names also appear at the top of the list, although the inclusion of Mikael Arteta may surprise. A good example of a pass before the assist more deep-lying player

Here are how some the leaders after 100 appearances fared over time

```{r team_assistsU_37}

choice <- playerGame %>%
  filter((START + subOn) > 0) %>%
  #filter(PLAYERID=="DEBRUYK") %>%
  arrange(gameDate) %>%
  group_by(PLAYERID) %>%
  mutate(order = row_number()) %>%
  filter(order <= 100) %>%
  group_by(name, PLAYERID) %>%
  summarize(totAssists = sum(Assists)) %>%
  filter(totAssists > 49) %>%
  pull(PLAYERID)


playerGame %>%
  filter(PLAYERID %in% choice & (START + subOn) > 0) %>%
  group_by(PLAYERID) %>%
  arrange(gameDate) %>%
  mutate(cumAss = cumsum(Assists), order = row_number()) %>%
  plot_ly(x =  ~ order,
          y =  ~ cumAss,
          color =  ~ name) %>%
  add_lines() %>% 
  layout(title="Cumulative Assists of leading Players",
         xaxis=list(title="Game Appearances"),
         yaxis= list(title="Cumulative Assists")) %>% config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)

```

_NB Zoom in as required, and double-clisk on legend for individual players_

Some points of interest

 * At the 100 game mark de Bruyne is a dozen ahead of any one else
 * Silva and Eriksen are showing a similar path
 * Arteta, in particular, tailed off considerably as he aged
 * Hazard has a long period - actually 922 minutes - without an assist in 2015/6
 He famously tuned out on Mourinho and had long goalless spell as well

#### Perfect Records {-}

Here are the best perfect records each year


```{r perfectU_37}

playerGame %>%
  filter(START > 0) %>%
  select(name, PLAYERID, TEAMMATCHID) %>%
  left_join(standings) %>%
  select(name, team, res, PLAYERID, season) %>%
  mutate(points = case_when(res == "Win" ~ 3,
                            res == "Draw" ~ 1,
                            res == "Loss" ~ 0)) %>%
  group_by(name, PLAYERID, team, season) %>%
  summarize(
    games = n(),
    sumPts = sum(points),
    avPts = round(sumPts / games, 2)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  filter(avPts == 3)  %>%
  arrange(desc(games)) %>%
  filter(games == max(games))   %>%
  arrange(desc(games), season) %>%
  select(season, player = name, team, games) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    class = 'compact stripe hover row-border order-column',
    rownames = FALSE,
    options = list(
      paging = TRUE,
      searching = TRUE,
      info = FALSE
    )
  )

```

Man City head the list for the consecutive year with Nolito (who holds the overall record at 9 and was sold at the end of the campaign) featuring last season

No-one even managed 2 games in 1993/94
