Dad,
 
Had a quick look around, was pretty easy to manoeuvre around to find out info. Didn't realise that Jason Puncheon had played 75 Premier League games for us! Furthermore, very interesting to know, also that Chelsea's bogey team is apparently Oldham!
 
Like you there wasn't any goals or cards for any team that I clicked on in the "Teams" section and I did wonder why, in the "Standings" section when you click on "Round" there wasn't a Goals Against column. I know there's not a huge need for it but it seems sensible if you were to include Goals For and Goal Difference then, especially as there's space in the final outcome, I would have expected a GA column too. 
 
Also, there's no standings before 2009 if you are looking for a specific date.
 
Apart from those few things it was easy to move around and look at the information which was clear and concise. I especially liked the current information part where it discusses milestones that players pass through each season and am assuming that's going to be kept up to date as this season progresses?
