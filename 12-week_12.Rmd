## Pulis is out {-}

Stodgy football and a points-per-game average lower than Steve Clarke will do that for you. His spell
at WBA ended with the lowest ppg average of any of his three clubs. The Welsh managership may come calling

## Flat Track Bullies {-}

With Pogba back and against moderate opposition, United were once again big winners. Lukaku ended his EPL goal drought at 434 minutes - coincidentally the exact period before his final goal for Everton

Although they are not quite keeping pace with Man City at the head of the table, Man United have recorded more games with at least four goals- in their case exactly four. 

Here is a chart showing their progress in comparison with other clubs that have started as strongly as them. Hover for details

```

The Liverpool side with the SSS strike-force of Suarez, Sterling and Sturridge backed up by Gerrard, Coutinho and Henderson ran up four goal tallies an amazing 11 times in a run of 24 games

<p class="factoid">With 12 assists to date, Kevin de Bruyne still leads the EPL table - three ahead of team-mante, David Silva - but has not registered one in last three outings</p>

## Final Factoid {-}

<p class="factoid">Man. Utd's go-ahead goal came via a left footed cross from Ashley Young. He never scores with it though. All 43 of his EPL goals have been with right foot</p>

## End of Season Update {-}

#### Pulis is Out {-}

Well I was wrong about the Wales managership - which went instead to Ryan Giigs. He took over at Middlesbrough and led them to ..

Of course WBA catastrophically signed Alan Pardew who led them to just 1 win .. before being sacked with the team 10 points from safety

#### Flat Track Bullies {-}

For the season as a whole Manchester United racked up .. games with four goals or more
trailing Manchester City () and Liverpool

More interstingly they have now gone five full seasons since putting up 5 in a single game. Since then 14 teams, including Hull (6-0 v Fulham) have, in total, posted .. with
Manchester City and Liverpool accounting for a combined..

```{r bullies_12u}

standings %>%
  filter(season > "2012/13", GF > 4) %>%
  count(team, sort = TRUE) %>%
  plot_ly(x =  ~ fct_reorder(team, -n), y =  ~ n) %>%
  add_bars(color = I("lightblue")) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Count of 5 goal games from 2013/4 to 2017/8",
    yaxis = list(title = "Count"),
    xaxis = list(title = ""),
    margin = list(b = 60, r=20)
  ) %>% config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)

```

de Bruyne comprehensively ran out winner of most assists and joined just Fabregas and Erikssen as players with two seasons with 25+ assists. Barring injury or transfer, he will be a good bet to achieve that feat again next season

---

Ashley Young scored a couple more goals in the season with, you guessed it, his right foot. He really stands out in this respect


```{r youngu_12}
Method %>%
  filter(PLAYERID != "OWNGOAL") %>%
  group_by(PLAYERID, name) %>%
  summarize(
    Head = sum(Head),
    Left = sum(Left),
    Right = sum(Right),
    tot = Head + Left + Right,
    pc = 100 * round(Right / tot, 3)
  ) %>%
  plot_ly(x =  ~ tot, y =  ~ pc) %>%
  add_markers(
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text =  ~ paste0(
      name,
      "<br>Right: ",
      Right,
      "<br>Total: ",
      tot,
      "<br> %: ",
      pc,
      "<br>"
    )
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Right-Footed Goals as a % of Total",
    xaxis = list(title = "Total Goals"),
    yaxis = list(title = "% Right Footed")
  ) %>% config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)
```

You will probably want to zoom( or rectangular select up to 50 Total Goals) and hover for more details
Milivojevis on .. is next with 100% record - and most of his are from the penalty spot
Noble has scored 35 of 36 with his right foot - the exception a left-footer in April 2008 v Newcastle.     

 On the flip side none of Chris Brunt's 25 have been with his right-peg
